Delete isn't working due to linked list not being sorted.

Here we can see (**) the entry is not sorted.

Perhaps the insert is broken.


==========================================================

del external_ref 'fee9c63084e09bc122dade3ad2a2086b|46406'

Removal of external ref doesn't seem to work.
Ideas.

Is internals of delete working?
Is the client forking a new child, then doing the del in the child ?
